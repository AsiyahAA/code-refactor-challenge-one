## Description
### Project purpose was to edit a functioning website in order to make the website more accessible to users and to clean up the HTML and CSS code and fix redundancies. Motivation for this project was to ensure users have access to the website and that all conditions of accessiblity are met. I used GitHub, Visual Studio Code and GitBash Terminal to download initial code, make edits to the code, and to upload all changes to Github.   
## User
### User should be able to see/hear a functioning website with clear headers, navigation links that work, images and icons with descriptions, clear paragraph structure, and a clear footer. 
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a repository and copy starter code onto computer and was used to deploy the website when edits where finished. Visual Studio Code was used for starter code and was used to make the edits to the HTML and CSS file. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update website.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command git clone and copying in the URL, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and starter code will show. Edits to the starter code can be made in the HTML and the CSS files which can be viewed in the "Open Browser" extention-search for and install "Open in Browser" extention in the VS side bar. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. Once changes are uploaded, navigate to the settings where your repository is displayed on GitHub and scroll down to Pages in the sidebar. Once there, under Source, select Branch:main and save. A link will then appear and although it will take time, the website will be ready.

## Status 
### Starter code was edited and redundancies were cleaned up and code was made more user accessible. There are still some edits that can be made to reduce redundancies and to make site even more accessible to users.
